# What is Constructor?

A Constructor is a special type of method that has the same name as the class name.

A constructor never contain any return type, including void.

# Use Of Constructor?

The main purpose of Constructor is to initialized the object.

Constructor is automatically call when we create object


# what is destructor?

it is the used to destroy the object that create by the constructor

A destructor is a special member function that works just opposite to constructor, unlike constructors that are used for initializing an object, destructors destroy (or delete) the object.

# Write the rules relating to a constructor.

The name of the constructor must be identical to the name of the class.

You must not include any return type, not even void!

A class can have any number of constructors, including none. The compiler automatically creates a constructor for a class that has none.

The default constructor is the one that either has no parameters or it has a parameter list in which all the parameters use default arguments.
