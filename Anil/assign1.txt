COMMAND 

cd:- The cd command, also known as chdir (change directory), is a command-line shell command used to change the current working directory in various operating systems. It can be used in shell scripts and batch files.

Mkdir:- The mkdir command in Linux/Unix allows users to create or make new directories. mkdir stands for “make directory.” With mkdir , you can also set permissions, create multiple directories (folders) at once, and much more.

Cat:- The cat command is a utility command in Linux. One of its most commonly known usages is to print the content of a file onto the standard output stream. Other than that, the cat command also allows us to write some texts into a file.

Ls:- The ls command is used to list files. "ls" on its own lists all files in the current directory except for hidden files. ... ls -a will list all files including hidden files (files with names beginning with a dot).
